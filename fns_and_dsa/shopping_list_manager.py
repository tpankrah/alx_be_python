#Objective: Utilize Python lists to create a simple shopping list manager that 
# allows users to add items, view the current list, and remove items.

#Task Description:
#Create a Python script named shopping_list_manager.py 
# that implements a simple interface for managing a shopping list. 
# This task focuses on using lists to store and manipulate data dynamically.

#Requirements:
#Core Functionality:

#Your script should start with an empty list named shopping_list.
#Implement functionality to add items to the list, remove items, and display the current list.
#User Interface:

#Use a loop to continuously display a menu with options to the user until they choose to exit. 
# The menu should offer options to add an item, remove an item, view the list, and exit.
#For adding items, prompt the user for the item name and append it to shopping_list.
#For removing items, ask the user for the item name and remove it from shopping_list. 
# If the item is not found, display a message indicating so.
#To view the list, print each item in shopping_list to the console.
#Ensure your script handles invalid menu choices gracefully.
#shopping_list_manager.py Skeleton:
#def display_menu():
#    print("Shopping List Manager")
#    print("1. Add Item")
#    print("2. Remove Item")
#    print("3. View List")
#    print("4. Exit")

#def main():
#    shopping_list = []
#    while True:
#        display_menu()
#        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

#        if choice == '1':
#            # Prompt for and add an item
#            pass
#        elif choice == '2':
#            # Prompt for and remove an item
#            pass
#        elif choice == '3':
#            # Display the shopping list
#            pass
#        elif choice == '4':
#            print("Goodbye!")
#            break
#        else:
#            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

#if __name__ == "__main__":
#    main()
#Note for Students:

#You are responsible for completing the main() function with 
# the appropriate logic to handle adding, removing, and displaying items in the shopping_list.
#This task introduces you to working with lists in a practical scenario, 
# enhancing your understanding of how dynamic data structures can be manipulated 
# and utilized in Python programs.

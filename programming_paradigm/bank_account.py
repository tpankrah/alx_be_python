# Objective: Understand the fundamentals of OOP in Python by implementing a 
# BankAccount class that encapsulates banking operations. 
# Use command line arguments to interact with instances of this class.

# Task Description:
# You will create two Python scripts: bank_account.py, 
# which contains the BankAccount class, and main-0.py, 
# which interfaces with the class through command line arguments to perform banking operations.

# bank_account.py:
# Class Definition:

# Define a class named BankAccount.
# Use the __init__ method to initialize an account_balance attribute. 
# Optionally, accept an initial balance parameter, defaulting to zero.
# Encapsulation and Behaviors:

# Implement deposit(amount), withdraw(amount), and display_balance() methods.
# deposit should add the specified amount to account_balance.
# withdraw should deduct the amount from account_balance if funds are sufficient, 
# returning True; otherwise, return False and do not alter the balance.
# display_balance should print the current balance in a user-friendly format.




class BankAccount:

    def __init__(self,account_balance=0):
        self.account_balance = account_balance

    def deposit(self,amount):
          self.account_balance = self.account_balance + amount
        # return self.account_balance
    
    def withdraw(self,amount):
        if(self.account_balance >= amount):
            self.account_balance -= amount
            return True
        else: 
            return False
        
    def display_balance(self):
        print(f'Current Balance: ${self.account_balance:.2f}')




# main-0.py for Command Line Interaction:
# This script utilizes BankAccount through command line arguments for banking operations.

# import sys
# from bank_account import BankAccount

# def main():
#     account = BankAccount(100)  # Example starting balance
#     if len(sys.argv) < 2:
#         print("Usage: python main.py <command>:<amount>")
#         print("Commands: deposit, withdraw, display")
#         sys.exit(1)

#     command, *params = sys.argv[1].split(':')
#     amount = float(params[0]) if params else None

#     if command == "deposit" and amount is not None:
#         account.deposit(amount)
#         print(f"Deposited: ${amount}")
#     elif command == "withdraw" and amount is not None:
#         if account.withdraw(amount):
#             print(f"Withdrew: ${amount}")
#         else:
#             print("Insufficient funds.")
#     elif command == "display":
#         account.display_balance()
#     else:
#         print("Invalid command.")

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()
# Sample Command Line Usage and Expected Outputs:
# Deposit:
#    python main-0.py deposit:50
# Expected Output: Deposited: $50

# Withdraw with Sufficient Funds:
#    python main-0.py withdraw:20
# Expected Output: Withdrew: $20

# Withdraw with Insufficient Funds:
#    python main-0.py withdraw:150
# Expected Output: Insufficient funds.

# Display Balance:
#    python main-0.py display
# Expected Output: Current Balance: $[amount]

# Implementation Notes for you:
# Ensure your BankAccount class in bank_account.py correctly implements 
# the specified functionalities and adheres to the principles of encapsulation.
# Use main.py to test your BankAccount class by performing various operations. 
# Adjust the initial balance as needed for testing different scenarios.
# This task combines learning OOP concepts with practical command line interaction, 
# enhancing your understanding of Python programming.

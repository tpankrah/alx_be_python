# Expected Outputs for Each Step in main.py:
# After Initial Setup:
#    Available books after setup:
#    Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
#    1984 by George Orwell
# After Checking Out ‘1984’:
#    Available books after checking out '1984':
#    Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
# After Returning ‘1984’:
#    Available books after returning '1984':
#    Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
#    1984 by George Orwell
# Note for you:
# Your Book class should provide methods to check a book out and return it, 
# affecting its availability.
# Your Library class needs to manage a collection of books, 
# including adding new books to the collection, 
# checking a book out (which marks it as unavailable), 
# returning it (making it available again), and listing all available books.
# Implementing these functionalities requires careful thought 
# about how objects interact with each other in terms of state and behavior.
# Use the provided main.py for testing your implementation. 
# The expected outputs give you a clear indication of how your 
#   program should behave if implemented correctly.

# Objective: Implement a division calculator that robustly handles errors 
# like division by zero and non-numeric inputs using command line arguments.

# Task Description:
# Create two Python scripts: robust_division_calculator.py, 
# which contains the division logic including error handling, 
# and main.py, 
# which interfaces with the user through the command line.

# robust_division_calculator.py:
# Define a function safe_divide(numerator, denominator) 
# that performs division, handling potential errors:

# Division by Zero: Use a try-except block to catch ZeroDivisionError.
# Non-numeric Input: Attempt to convert arguments to floats. 
# Use a try-except block to catch ValueError for non-numeric inputs.
# Return appropriate messages for errors or the result for successful division.

def safe_divide(numerator, denominator):

    try:
        numerator,denominator = float(numerator), float(denominator)
    except ValueError:
      return 'Error: Please enter numeric values only.'

    try:
        result = numerator / denominator
        return f"The result of the division is {result}"
    except ZeroDivisionError:
       return "Error: Cannot divide by zero."
    






# main.py for Command Line Interaction:
# This script will import safe_divide from robust_division_calculator.py 
# and use it to divide numbers provided as command line arguments.

# import sys
# from robust_division_calculator import safe_divide

# def main():
#     if len(sys.argv) != 3:
#         print("Usage: python main.py <numerator> <denominator>")
#         sys.exit(1)

#     numerator = sys.argv[1]
#     denominator = sys.argv[2]

#     result = safe_divide(numerator, denominator)
#     print(result)

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()
# Expected Behavior:
# The script is executed from the command line with two additional 
# arguments representing the numerator and denominator. 
# Here are sample commands and the expected outputs:

# Normal Division:
#   python main.py 10 5
# Expected Output: The result of the division is 2.0

# Division by Zero:
#   python main.py 10 0
# Expected Output: Error: Cannot divide by zero.

# Invalid Input (Non-numeric):
#   python main.py ten 5
# Expected Output: Error: Please enter numeric values only.

# Implementation Notes for you:
# Focus on error handling within safe_divide in robust_division_calculator.py. 
# Ensure you cover the scenarios detailed above.
# Test your function using main.py by passing different types of inputs via command line arguments. 
# This method allows you to quickly assess how well your error handling works in various situations.
# This task helps you practice writing error-resistant code, a crucial skill in software development.
